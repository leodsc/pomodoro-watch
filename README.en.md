## What is this app?

It is possible to organize your activities using the pomodoro technique. It consists in split tasks across some predefined time, and after that period, take a break for a few minutes so that a good proportion of work/rest is achieved. More details can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

To start a task you must click on the button at the center of the app. After that, the time will start to run, and when it finishes an alarm will sound then the rest time will start. When it finishes, a new alarm will sound and start the next task/continue the previous one.

The app saves the time spent with activities when they finish, and, the app closes before finishing a task, the time spent with it will be saved as well. The time spent is used to calculate data on user usage. This data can be seem on the superior left menu of the app, clicking in "Dados", or going to this [link](https://pomodoro-timer.netlify.app/uso).



Future implementations include:

☐ User system

☐ Analyse data between two dates

☐ Add task name that is beign done

☐ Login/signup with social media
